Now that the MMA year is over following UFC 296, I'm doing round two on predicting UFC champs for the coming year. [My predictions from last year](http://jackbisceglia.com/blog/2023ufcpredictions) went surprisingly well. There was lots of craziness; fighters competing in different divisions, title vacancies, fights ending in draws, etc. I'll recap last year real quick, and then move on to 2024 predictions.

### 2023 Recap 

I successfully predicted 6/10 champs to end the year, which I'd consider a success. I missed out on some really tough to predict picks like Strickland and Pereira, which I didn't even consider to be plausible fights to book at the year's start. I also lost out on my Moreno pick in a fantastic 5 round loss to Pantoja at IFW in July, as Blanchfield at Women's 125 as she never got her chance at the title due to the wild 2 fight hold up between Grasso and Schevchenko. 

As for my correct picks, I had a few that were on the money, and some others that weren't all too difficult to make. Jon simply made light work of Gane in March. Volk only ended up with 1 defense at 145 in which he made a supremely dangerous Yair Rodriguez look one-dimensional. Makhachev needed only 2 defenses against the same matchup in Volkanovski, the second of which was incredibly impressive despite the short-notice nature. In light of some of those more simple picks, I did choose O'Malley to reach the top at 135, which he successfully did in August to the certain surprise of Vegas, and, finally, I correctly picked Edwards to maintain his hold on 170 with a defense at home over Usman that he followed up with a systematic breakdown of Covington in December. A pretty decent year!

### Men's Heavyweight

If I had my choice, we'd be getting Jones vs. Aspinall in a title unification bout towards the end of 2024 when Jones is recovered. Should that fight happen, I'm not sure who I'd pick but it would definitely be a tight call. It unfortunately looks like the matchmakers are deadset on rescheduling the Jones vs Miocic matchup when possible, and although it's (supposedly) historically impactful, I don't see a world where Jon doesn't win definitively. So the question becomes, what happens afterwards? I'm going run with the assumption that this would be Jones' retirement fight and Aspinall gets his chance at becoming undisputed in 2024. The only problematic matchup I see for him is Almeida but with the questions surrounding him, I'm gonna go with Aspinall.

- **265 lb. Champion: Tommy Aspinall**

### Men's Light Heavyweight

This division is a nightmare to pick for. Somehow Pereira found his second title before getting his 10th MMA fight and I don't doubt that his success continues. I picked Jiri to get the belt back in the start of 2023 and although I do see that rematch down the road, I'm not confident he gets it done. Ankalaev and Rakic are interesting to consider, and there's always the Pereira vs. Adesanya MMA trilogy one weight class up floating around as well. I'm not really sure, but Pereira is probably the best bet.

- **205 lb. Champion: Alex Pereira**

### Men's Middleweight

Here's another division that's been turned upside down. After years of being dominated by Robert Whittaker and Israel Adesanya, we find ourselves in a world where neither guy is an immediate title challenger. I think Strickland likely beats DDP in January, but then we have another 11 months of matchmaking to consider. There's Khamzat who either fights in Q1, or waits until May or June and I doubt it's for the title, so *maybe* he gets his shot in October. There's also the Usman component, thought I don't find it likely. I'm **really** not sure, but I like when Adesanya is champ so I'll roll with it.

- **185 lb. Champion: Israel Adesanya**

### Men's Welterweight

Welterweight is another tough one. I really like Leon as champ; I think he's got a great story and his last three wins are as good for the resume as any. For the sake of merit, I'd have to hope that Belal is next in line, and though Belal is extremely tough, I think Leon wins that. Thereafter, though, it's a tough road. There's Shavkat who could be looking for 20-0 with 20 finishes by that point. Then there's the threat of Makhachev moving up, who'd be another tough fight. I'm generally of the belief that the division is Shavkat's and it's literally only a matter of time. I got burned last year, though, assuming that rising contenders will get their shot sooner rather than later, so I'll ride with Edwards, for now.

- **170 lb. Champion: Leon Edwards**

### Men's Lightweight

Makhachev. The easiest pick of the bunch for me without question. Take any reasonable contender: if Islam wins, they've not earned a rematch, and if Islam loses, he *will* deserve a rematch. Could Gaethje or Oliveira (*or maybe Tsarukyan*) beat him? Sure, I think counting out either guy probably unwise. Could Could Gaethje or Oliveira (*or maybe Tsarukyan*) beat Islam *twice*? **No**. 

- **155 lb. Champion: Islam Makhachev**

### Men's Featherweight

Volkanovski vs Topuria is an incredible matchup. Volk is at the mountain top and he is simply as skilled pound-for-pound as anyone else on the roster. Topuria is *scary*. I think there's a real chance that Volk is up against the toughest contender since Max 1/2, and having to handle this only 4 months after a, really, brutal headkick TKO does not necessarily stack the odds in his favor. I'm grappling with the issue of the past few years that is, every contender essentially needs to win the belt twice when fighting a guy this decorate as he'll be guaranteed a rematch. There's Max, and now, Aljo in the rearview to consider as well. Maybe I'm getting sold on the hype, but as a fan of Volk I unfortunately have to pick Topuria.

- **145 lb. Champion: Ilia Topuria**

### Men's Bantamweight

O'Malley is gonna beat Chito pretty easily I think. I like both guys; they both (usually) have fun styles of fight. I do think that O'Malley was, more or less, doing what he wanted to in the first fight and although Chito put his stamp on that first meeting, I think O'Malley has noticeably improved. He has the better striking, his TDD has held up, and he can be somewhat crafty off his back when he needs to be (at least enough to have created some separation against Yan). Past that, Merab is simply a brutal matchup. I'm gonna guess that he finds a way into a defense against Cejudo or Sandhagen, in which I favor O'Malley still. 

- **135 lb. Champion: Sean O'Malley**

### Men's Flyweight

My favorite non-155 division. The top is stacked: Pantoja is awesome, Moreno is awesome, Figgy was awesome before moving up. Then there's the rising guys like Mokaev, Erceg, and Taira who also look promising. I think anyone in the top 8 could win the title on any given night so this is a tough pick. I've got Moreno over Albazi in their fight which sets up the 3rd (+ a TUF fight) fight between Pantoja and Moreno. Both guys are cool and fun to watch. I picked Moreno last year so I guess I'll just run with that again, hard to beat a guy 3 (kinda 4) times in a row.

- **125 lb. Champion: Brandon Moreno**

### Women's Bantamweight

I don't really know. Amanda was like 100000x better than everyone else. I guess I'll go Julianna Peña since she'll get her shot closer to the end of the year.

- **135 lb. Champion: Julianna Peña**

### Women's Flyweight

Blanchfield. I said Makhachev was the easiest pick, but I take that back. I guess they're gonna do Grasso vs. Valentina 3 which concerns me a bit considering a Valentina win *might* mean a fourth fight and another delay for Blanchfield. Nonetheless, Blanchfield runs through Fiorot in their upcoming fight and then it's just a question of when they give Blanchfield the shot. 

- **125 lb. Champion: Erin Blanchfield**

### Women's Strawweight

For 115 I'm pretty much between Weili and Tatiana Suarez. Weili is incredibly good and has proven that time and time again. I don't really think Weili was as good in the Rose fights as she is currently, and just about every other fight has been easy for her. Suarez and Xionan are the only real options right now. Weili vs Xionan would be a cool fight, but Weili would win. I think we probably see the Suarez matchup this year, and although Suarez's wrestling is probably way better than Weili's, I'm not sure I trust her striking enough to not get cracked on her entries. 

- **115 lb. Champion: Zhang Weili**

### Concluding

These picks are like infinitely tougher than last year. I have a few that I feel very confident in, but the majority are pretty much reaches. I don't foresee getting 6 right like last year, I'd be happy with maybe 4. Outside of Blanchfield and Makhachev, I'm not super confident at all. I think Aspinall is the best Heavyweight right now but timing isn't on his side. I think the UFC would like O'Malley as champ, but I'm not sure how long you can keep Merab out of the picture. Should be interesting.
